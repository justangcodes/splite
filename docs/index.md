# Terms of Service

You acknowledge that you have the privilege to use the bot freely on any Discord Server (Server) you share with it, that you can invite it to any Server that you have "Manage Server" rights for and that this privilege might get revoked for you, if you're subject of breaking the terms and/or policy of this bot, or the Terms of Service, Privacy Policy and/or Community Guidelines of Discord Inc.

Through Inviting the bot may it collect specific data as described in its Policy.
The intended usage of this data is for core functionalities of the bot such as command handling, guild-specific settings and the Welcoming System.

## Intended Age
The bot may not be used by individuals under the minimal age described in Discord's Terms of Service.
Features, such as commands which are marked as "NSFW" (Not safe for work) may not be used by individuals under the age of maturity in their country. Doing so will be seen as a violation of these terms and will result in a removal of the bot from any servers you own.

## Affiliation
The Bot is not affiliated with, supported or made by Discord Inc.
Any direct connection to Discord or any of its Trademark objects is purely coincidental. We do not claim to have the copyright ownership of Discord's assets, trademarks or other intellectual property.

## Liability
The owner of the bot may not be made liable for individuals breaking these Terms at any given time.
He has faith in the end users being truthfully about their information and not misusing this bot or The Services of Discord Inc in a malicious way.

We reserve the right to update these terms at our own discretion, giving you a 1-Week (7 days) period to opt out of these terms if you're not agreeing with the new changes.

# Privacy Policy
## Usage of Data
The bot may use stored data for different purposes, including but not limited to:
- Storing the guild-specific settings of the bot (Corresponding commands are prefixed with 'set' and 'clear')
- Providing the command handling of the bot
- Feature usage

No usage of data outside the aforementioned cases will happen and under no circumstances will the data be shared with third parties.

## Stored Information
The bot may store the following guild information upon joining a server:

id with the Server's ID as value.
name with value of the server's name.
systemChannelID with the ID of the channel the bot should send messages to.

No other information outside the above-mentioned one will be stored AUTOMATICALLY.

## Updating Data
The data may be updated when using specific commands.
Updating data will require the input of an end user, and data that can be seen as sensitive, such as content of a message, may need to be stored when using certain commands.

No other actions may update the stored information at any given time.

## Temporarily stored Information
The Bot may keep the stored information in an internal caching mechanic for a certain amount of time.
After this time period, the cached information will be dropped and only be re-added when required.

Data may be dropped from cache pre-maturely through actions such as removing the bot from the Server.

## Removal of Data
### Automatic removal
Stored Data can be removed automatically through means of removing the bot from a Server. This can be achieved by either kicking or banning the bot from the server. Re-inviting the bot will add the same default values, as mentioned above, back to the bot's' database.

### Manual removal
Manual removal of the data can be requested by contacting the developer splite@ahmadz.ai with the subject 'Removal of Splite Data'.
For security reasons will we ask you to provide us with proof of ownership of the server, that you wish the data to be removed of. Only a server owner may request manual removal of data and requesting it will result in the bot being removed from the server, if still present on it.
